USER INPUT: "{user_input}"

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
CRITICAL EXTRACTION & ANALYSIS:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

1. DEEP TEXT MINING - Extract Everything:
   • Parse ALL information: skills, experience, education, achievements, tools, technologies, companies, roles, years, projects, certifications
   • Identify implicit skills relevant to mentioned technologies
   • Expand abbreviations keeping both (e.g., "ML" → "Machine Learning (ML)")
   • Infer related technologies (React → JavaScript, Node.js, npm, Webpack)
   • Calculate derived metrics ("3 years" → started {current_year - 3})
   • NEVER discard details - everything has value

2. INTELLIGENT KEYWORD ENHANCEMENT:
   • Inject 30-50 industry-specific ATS keywords
   • Primary keywords: {', '.join(keywords['technical'][:12])}
   • Soft skills: {', '.join(keywords['soft_skills'][:8])}
   • Power verbs: {', '.join(keywords['action_verbs'][:12])}
   • Include variations: "JavaScript (JS)", "Artificial Intelligence (AI)"
   • Use full stacks: "MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js)"
   • Add buzzwords: Agile/Scrum, CI/CD, Microservices, Cloud-Native

3. RECRUITER PSYCHOLOGY - First 6 Seconds Matter:
   • F-Pattern reading: Most important keywords in first 3 lines
   • Numbers attract eyes: Every bullet needs metrics (%, $, X users, Y% improvement)
   • Skills hierarchy: In-demand skills first
   • Recent = Relevant: Emphasize recent experience
   • Problem-Solution-Impact: Each bullet shows challenge → action → result

4. PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY (40% of ATS Score) - MUST BE COMPELLING & MAGNETIC:
   
   CRITICAL: This summary must make recruiters STOP and READ. Use power words, achievements, and create urgency.
   
   EXACT 4-5 sentence structure with IMPACT-DRIVEN language:
   
   Sentence 1: "[DYNAMIC descriptor] [Job Title] with [X+] years of [impressive achievement], specializing in [2-3 cutting-edge technologies]"
      • Use descriptors: "Results-driven", "Award-winning", "Innovative", "High-performing", "Strategic"
      • Add flair: "passionate about", "excels at", "dedicated to"
   
   Sentence 2: "Proven track record of [IMPRESSIVE achievement with BIG metric] and [IMPACTFUL achievement], resulting in [BUSINESS VALUE in $, %, or scale]"
      • Focus on: Revenue growth, cost savings, user scale, performance gains
      • Use powerful verbs: "Spearheaded", "Pioneered", "Orchestrated", "Transformed"
   
   Sentence 3: "Deep expertise in [5-6 technical skills with modern context]: {', '.join(keywords['technical'][:6])}, driving [business outcome]"
      • Connect tech to business value
      • Use phrases: "leveraging cutting-edge", "mastering", "expert-level proficiency"
   
   Sentence 4: "Recognized for [standout quality] with exceptional [2-3 soft skills]: {', '.join(keywords['soft_skills'][:3])}, consistently [impressive outcome]"
      • Highlight uniqueness
      • Use: "renowned for", "celebrated for", "distinguished by"
   
   Sentence 5: "Eager to leverage [unique value proposition] to [ambitious goal] at [inspiring company descriptor], driving [transformation/growth/innovation]"
      • Forward-looking and aspirational
      • Show ambition and cultural fit
   
   TONE: Confident, achievement-obsessed, energetic, forward-thinking
   KEYWORDS: 12-15 technical + soft skill keywords in 130-160 words
   IMPACT: Must include minimum 3 quantified achievements with impressive metrics

5. ATS PARSING OPTIMIZATION (30% of ATS Score):
   • EXACT headers: "Professional Summary", "Technical Skills", "Professional Experience", "Projects", "Education", "Certifications", "Achievements"
   • Multiple keyword forms: "ML (Machine Learning)", "API (Application Programming Interface)"
   • Tool + Version: "React 18", "Python 3.11", "Node.js 20"
   • Skill + Context: "REST APIs", "Agile Scrum", "CI/CD Automation"
   • Front-load keywords in first 3 bullets
   • Repeat top 5 keywords 3-4x across sections

6. ACHIEVEMENT FORMULA - CAR Method (Context-Action-Result):
   
   Format: "[ACTION VERB] + [specific technical implementation] + [using X, Y, Z] + [achieving/resulting in] + [QUANTIFIED METRIC] + [business impact]"
   
   Metrics Required:
   • Performance: "by X%", "X% faster", "reduced A to B"
   • Scale: "serving Xk users", "processing Xk transactions/day"
   • Time: "X weeks ahead", "reducing time by X hours"
   • Business: "$Xk revenue", "X% cost reduction", "X% user growth"
   
   If no metrics provided, INFER realistic ones:
   • Web app → "serving 1,000+ users", "99.5% uptime"
   • Optimization → "reducing load time 30-50%", "improving performance 40%"
   • Team work → "coordinating 5-8 member team"

7. TECHNICAL SKILLS (20% of ATS Score):
   
   Priority-based organization:
   • Programming Languages: Most relevant first (from input) + related ones
   • Frameworks & Libraries: Full ecosystem (React → React, Redux, Next.js)
   • Cloud & DevOps: AWS/Azure/GCP, Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD
   • Databases: SQL and NoSQL options
   • Tools & Platforms: Version control, project management
   • Methodologies: Agile, Scrum, DevOps, TDD
   
   Rules:
   • Extract ALL mentioned technologies
   • Add complementary tech (React → JavaScript, TypeScript, npm)
   • Include industry standards (Git, REST APIs, JSON)
   • Add proficiency: "Python (Advanced)", "AWS (Intermediate)"
   • Total: 25-40 skills across 4-6 categories

8. EXPERIENCE - Extraction & Enhancement:
   
   Extract from input:
   • Company names, titles, dates (infer if vague)
   • Technologies → highlight in bullets
   • Numbers/metrics → amplify them
   • Responsibilities → convert to achievements
   
   Each Job Entry:
   • Title with seniority (Junior/Mid-level/Senior)
   • Company + industry context
   • 3-5 achievement bullets (max 5)
   • Each bullet: 1-2 lines, front-loaded keywords
   • Technologies in context
   
   Bullet Priority:
   1st: Biggest achievement with best metrics
   2nd: Technical depth showing expertise
   3rd: Collaboration/leadership impact
   4th-5th: Additional technical achievements
   
   If NO experience: Create internship/project-based roles, use academic projects

9. PROJECTS - Turn Everything Into Projects:
   
   Extract:
   • Any app/website/tool → full project entry
   • Coursework → reframe as projects
   • Hackathons, bootcamp work → showcase
   • Personal learning → "personal projects"
   
   Each Project:
   • Compelling title (professional)
   • FULL tech stack (8-12 technologies)
   • 2-3 achievement bullets with metrics
   • GitHub link (infer URL) + demo link
   • Business problem + impact
   
   Project Metrics (infer):

    • Relevant coursework (6-8 courses with keywords)
    • Honors (Dean's List, scholarships, awards)
    • Academic projects (reference in Projects section)
    
    If minimal: Infer standard degree, add typical coursework, include online certs

    • Passive voice ("was responsible for")
    • Paragraphs (only bullets)
    • Irrelevant details
